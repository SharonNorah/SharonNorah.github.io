              One of the biggest problems nowadays in homes is increasing rates at which infants are being injured due to accessing areas that are dangerous to them and it is high time to offer a safety support system for the infants in every home area. This paper focuses on implementing the RFID-based children Monitoring System for every child at home.

            <p class="text">
              A parent is a caretaker of a child. Being parent means you have a responsibility of taking care of your children. However children at infant stages are there infant stages are a bit difficult to monitor for example a parent can be busy with work some where and the child crowls to a place dangerous for his or life. Such places include, kitchen area, toilets, swimming pools. Of recent, one of Uganda’s miniters lost his twins to drowning.This happened because the parent/ guardian of the children were not alerted at the time the children reached the swimming pool at home which is so sad.It is important that a system is developed to help the parents and guardians of infants at home monitor the movements of their children.An RFID- based CMS has been developed for this cause. The system will monitor a child’s movements in the home and alert the parents/guardian as soon the child reaches the vicinity of a dangerous area.

            </p>
            <h3>Significance of the system</h3>
            <p class="text">
              The system is real time and therefore it will help parents/guardians rescue their children from being badly injured. The following functionalities help the parents/guardiandians rescue their children from danger orveven losing their lives.

            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              The RFID reader is placed into the target room/area and RFID tag is attached to the infant. Whenever an infant  moves to the target room/area, the tag and reader communication will occur and automatically SMS will sent to their parents and also the alerting system will activate. To avoid the infants in a home from being burnt or injured, the main objective of child monitoring system is to effectively integrate a system that could monitor infants through information technology by using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, GSM module, and an Active RFID module embedded, to ensure the complete safety of the infant.The Architecture of the RFID based child monitoring system installed in the target room of the house. It comprises of a module which senses the unique identification number (UID) from the tag attached an infant .

            <hr>
            <h3>Microcontroller(Arduino Uno)</h3>
            <p class="text">
             This section forms the control unit of the whole project. This section basically consists of a Micro controller with its associated circuitry like Pull up resistors and so on. The Micro controller forms the heart of the project because it controls the devices being interfaced and communicates with the devices according to the program being written.
             <h3> RFID Reader</h3>
             <p class="text">
           This module comprises of an Arduino microprocessor which is attached with a and an RFID reader. This module takes UID from RFID reader and sends it to the Arduino Module .The reader used here is a  RFID reader. RFID tags and readers have to be tuned to the same frequency in order to communicate.
            </p>
            <h3>Passive RFID tag</h3>
             <p class="text">
            RFID tags contain a chip which holds an electronic product code (EPC) number that points to additional data detailing the contents of the package. Readers identify the UID numbers at a distance, without involving physical contact. This the active RFID tag that will be attached to the infant such that if the infant goes to the kitchen,an alarming signal will be sent to the micro controller.
            </p>
            <h3>Alarm System module</h3>
            <p class="text">
            This system comprises of an alarm buzzer. It will trigger the alarm if the infant appears in the target room and the RFID reader identifies the UID number.
            </p>
            <h3>GSM SIM800L</h3>
             <p class="text">
            GSM SIM800L can be used to send SMS, receive SMS and make the calls. The basic GSM operations are done with the help of AT commands. The following are the AT commands used in our system:
           <p class="text"> AT: It is used to test the condition of the GSM. It responds with an OK if everything is fine or an ERROR in case of error.
            <p class="text"> AT+CMGF=1: Command to set the communication to Text Mode.
             <p class="text"> AT+CMGS=[Mobile Number]: Command to send SMS from the GSM Modem to particular number as mentioned in command.
            </p>
            <h3>Battery</h3>

              After testing the RFID-based CMS, the following conclusions can be stated.
          </div>
          <div class="flex-item flex-column">
            <p class="text">
              The RFID-based CMS triggers an alarm and sends an SMS message to the parent/guardian as soon as the child reaches the vicinity of the area with the RFID reader
          </div>
          <div class="flex-item flex-column">
            <p class="text">
              The system requires that an RFID reader is placed in every area that restricted to the child. This is not efficient enough. We plan to use a Geo-fencing technology to create a virtual border around a single point of the restricted area which will help limit the need more many sensors.
